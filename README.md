# <module-01-accessibility-standards>

## Description

The motivation to complete this project was to gain a better understanding of html and css code by improving the accessibility of the website. 
The reason for building this project was to add or modify the css and html code so that all links functioned correctly, consolidate the css stylesheet, add comments describing the changes, and help the website meet accessibility standards.
One problem that was solved specifically was making the "Search Engine Optimization" function correctly. There were also "alt" tags added to each image to improve accessibility. There was also a problem with the consolodation of the CSS code and improvements were made to make the code more organized.
I learned how to implement accessibility standards into a website and how to combine css selectors into a selector list if the same rules apply to the css selectors.
